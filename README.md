# Mapper

Heavily based on the [Lyft](https://github.com/lyft/mapper) implementation, this library has been refactored for Swift 5.0 and enables Swift Package.

Mapper is a simple Swift library to convert JSON to strongly typed objects. One advantage to Mapper over some other libraries is you can have immutable properties.


## Installation

**With** [Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/polarcop/mapper.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
